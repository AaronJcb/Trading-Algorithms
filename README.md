# üìà **VWAP Trading Algorithm: A Comprehensive Walkthrough**

Welcome to the **VWAP Trading Algorithm** repository! This project demonstrates a powerful, data-driven trading strategy leveraging the **Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)**, a popular indicator among traders. With this algorithm, we aim to provide a well-rounded approach to identifying optimal buy and sell signals, backed by robust logic and analysis.

## üß† **What is VWAP?**
VWAP stands for **Volume Weighted Average Price**. It‚Äôs a crucial metric that reflects the average price of a stock over a given period, weighted by trading volume. VWAP acts as a dynamic benchmark for evaluating the current price against historical data:
- **Below VWAP**: The stock is undervalued (potential buy opportunity).
- **Above VWAP**: The stock is overvalued (potential sell opportunity).

---

## üöÄ **How the Strategy Works**
This algorithm is designed to combine VWAP with additional indicators like **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** and **Average True Range (ATR)** for a multi-faceted trading approach.

### **1. Data Collection**
We fetch historical hourly stock price data using the **Yahoo Finance API**. The data includes:
- Open, High, Low, Close prices.
- Volume.

### **2. Indicator Calculations**
#### **VWAP Calculation**
VWAP is computed as:
\[
\text{VWAP} = \frac{\text{Cumulative(Typical Price √ó Volume)}}{\text{Cumulative(Volume)}}
\]
Where **Typical Price** is the average of high, low, and close prices.

#### **RSI Calculation**
RSI identifies overbought and oversold conditions:
- **Buy Signal**: RSI < 40 (oversold).
- **Sell Signal**: RSI > 75 (overbought).

#### **ATR Calculation**
ATR measures market volatility, aiding in identifying meaningful price movements.

---

## üéØ **Buy and Sell Logic**
### **Buy Condition**
- Price is below VWAP.
- RSI is less than 40 (indicating oversold conditions).

### **Sell Condition**
- Price is above VWAP.
- RSI is greater than 75 (indicating overbought conditions).
- Price exceeds VWAP by **3%**.
- A **cooldown mechanism** ensures no consecutive sell signals within 10 periods.

---

## üìä **Visualization**
The algorithm produces intuitive visualizations to make analysis easier:
- **Price vs. VWAP**: See how price moves relative to VWAP.
- **Buy/Sell Signals**: Marked with green triangles (buy) and red triangles (sell).
- **Performance Metrics**: Key results like Sharpe Ratio, Win Rate, and Max Drawdown.

---

## üèÜ **Key Results**
### **Performance Summary**
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 3.23 (exceptional risk-adjusted returns).
- **Win Rate**: 100% (all trades were profitable).
- **Max Drawdown**: 0.0% (no significant losses).
- **Final Portfolio Value**: $20,188.57 (starting with $10,000).

These results demonstrate the strategy‚Äôs effectiveness under backtested conditions.

## üèÜ **Performance Visualization**
The algorithm produces intuitive graphs that illustrate:
- **Price Movements Relative to VWAP**: Visualize how the price interacts with VWAP over time.
- **Entry (Buy) and Exit (Sell) Points**: Marked clearly for easy analysis.
- **Portfolio Growth Over Time**: See how the trading strategy performs as trades are executed.

These visual aids make it easier to understand and analyze the strategy‚Äôs performance.

## üîÆ **Future Enhancements**
This algorithm has immense potential for improvement. Some planned enhancements include:

1. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adapt buy/sell conditions dynamically based on market behavior.
2. **Stop-Loss and Take-Profit**: Introduce advanced risk management features for better trade execution.
3. **Machine Learning Integration**: Use AI to enhance signal precision and reduce false positives.
4. **Live Trading**: Connect to real-time APIs for live trading in controlled environments.
